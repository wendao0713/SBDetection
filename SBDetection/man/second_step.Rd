\title{Second Step Analysis in Time Series Breakpoint Detection}
\description{
  Performs a second step analysis in time series data to refine breakpoint detection, using a backward selection process based on an information criterion.
}
\usage{
second_step(data, lambda, pts, omega, p, max_iteration = 1000, tol = 1e-4, step_size = 1e-3)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{A matrix representing the time series data, where each column is a separate time series.}
  \item{lambda}{A vector of lambda values for the LASSO penalty.}
  \item{pts}{A vector of initial breakpoints in the time series.}
  \item{omega}{A penalty parameter for the number of breakpoints in the model.}
  \item{p}{An integer specifying the order of the time series model.}
  \item{max_iteration}{An optional integer specifying the maximum number of iterations. Default is 1000.}
  \item{tol}{An optional numeric value indicating the tolerance for convergence. Default is 1e-4.}
  \item{step_size}{An optional numeric value indicating the step size for the optimization algorithm. Default is 1e-3.}
}
\value{
  A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item{pts}: {A vector of the refined breakpoints after the analysis.}
    \item{ic}: {The value of the information criterion after the final iteration.}
  }
}
\details{
  The `second_step` function applies a backward selection process to refine the detection of breakpoints in time series data. It iteratively removes breakpoints that do not significantly improve the fit of the model, as judged by an information criterion that balances model fit and complexity.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Generate sample data
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
# Define lambda values
lambda <- seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1)
# Initial breakpoints
pts <- c(25, 50, 75)
# Perform second step analysis
result <- second_step(data, lambda, pts, omega = 0.5, p = 2)
# View results
print(result)
